# Pryzm Node Deployment
This repository contains Ansible scripts for the installation, updating, and removal of a Pryzm node on Linux systems. The playbooks are designed to simplify the process of setting up a Pryzm node, managing its services, and streamlining node operations.

## Prerequisites
A Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended) with root access and docker installed.
Git and Ansible version 2.15 or newer installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Installing Dependencies
Update your system's package list:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install Ansible and Git:
```
sudo apt install ansible git -y
```

### Step 2: Downloading the Project

Clone this repository to access the Ansible playbook and all necessary files:

```
git clone https://github.com/nodemasterpro/deploy-node-pryzm.git
cd deploy-node-pryzm
```

### Step 3: Installing Pryzm Node
Execute the playbook using the following command, specifying the moniker (node name) as an extra variable:

```
ansible-playbook install_pryzm_feeder.yml -e moniker="your_node_name"
```
Note: The moniker is the name of your node.


### Step 4: Viewing Logs Pryzm node
To view the logs for the Pryzm node:
```
journalctl -u pryzm-node -f -o cat
```

### Step 5: Requesting Testnet Funds
Request Testnet Funds: After installing the Pryzm feeder, request testnet funds by providing the Pryzm feeder wallet address generated at the end of the `install_pryzm_feeder.yml` script execution. Visit https://testnet.pryzm.zone/faucet to request funds. You will need the wallet address provided at the end of the Pryzm 
Check Node Synchronization: To ensure your node is fully synchronized, execute:
```
pryzmd status | jq .SyncInfo
```

### Step 6: Checking Node Synchronization
To check the synchronization status of your node after installing Pryzm Feeder, use the following command:
```
pryzmd status | jq .SyncInfo
```
Wait for 30 minutes to an hour for the node to synchronize. When the catching_up variable is set to false, your node is synchronized.

### Step 7: Creating the Validator and Linking to the Feeder
Once Pryzm Feeder is installed and your node is synchronized, execute the following playbook to create a validator and link it to the feeder:
```
ansible-playbook create_validator_and_link_feeder.yml
```
During this step, you will be prompted to input the following information:

moniker : "node_name"
details : "a sentence of your choice"
website : "your website"
contact info : "how to contact you"
feeder : "the wallet feeder address"

### Step 8: Viewing state validator

You can check your state validator by pasting your valoper adresse https://testnet.chainsco.pe/pryzm.  The valoper address is provided at the end of the execution of the create_validator_and_link_feeder.yml script.

## Additional Note

### Stopping Services
To stop the Pryzm node and Pryzm feeder services: 
```
sudo systemctl stop pryzm-node
sudo systemctl stop pryzm-feeder
```

### Starting Services
To start the Pryzm node and Pryzm feeder services: 
```
sudo systemctl stop pryzm-node
sudo systemctl stop pryzm-feeder
```
### Removing the Pryzm Node
To remove the Pryzm node and Pryzm feeder, simply run the playbook again with the action set to remove:

```
ansible-playbook remove_node_pryzm.yml
```

Make sure to back up any important data before removing the Pryzm node, as this action may delete node data.
